Changes:

TODOS:
- Default table with headerVisible, showLines, etc.

0.5: 
- Updated to Eclipse 3.5 libraries.

0.4.2:

- bind with closures. If you bind with a closure it is like a ComputedValue which only gives 
  you one-way binding.
- menu as a subnode to menuitem should automatically set the menuitem.menu
- Added a Bindable and WritableList that can be used from several threads but only fires events
  in the right realm. 
- Using system colors (foreground: 'BLUE') for color attributes.
- Change the license to Apache as the rest of groovy.
- Upgraded to Eclipse 3.5M7

0.4.1:

- added initial databinding support
- shortened the onEvent(). Instead of onEvent(type:'Selection', closure:{...}) 
  you can use onEvent('Selection') {...}
- added StackLayout
- added InputDialog
- added ErrorDialog
- added MessageDialog
- added MessageDialogWithToggle
- added an id attribute
- changed list() to use default styles: SWT.V_SCROLL | SWT.BORDER
- added a subclass of the Shell and added a method doMainloop() to do all the repetitive:
		pack();
		open();
		while (!isDisposed()) {
			if (!getDisplay().readAndDispatch()) {
				getDisplay().sleep();
			}
		}


0.4.0:
- updated gmaven
- updated to Eclipse 3.4
- changed swt/jface builders to groovy
- added the id attribute

- Change builders to support FactoryBuilderSupport to be able to 
  use SWT in Griffon.
  
- Deleted the ApplicationGuiBuilder in groovy.swt.guibuilder. This 
  was marked as "WORK IN PROGRESS, don't use this one yet" in 2004,
  so I don't suppose anyone was using it.
  
- Delete the get/setCurrent methods from the builders. Was only used by the
  GuiBuilders.
  
- Fixed a bug:
	fillLayout ( type:"vertical" )
  never worked. Strings are now matched against SWT constants if relevant.
  
- Included the MigLayout in the SwtBuilder

- Make 'text' default attribute if a text is given without attribute. You can now use
  	label('label text')
  instead of
    label(text:'label text')

- Using SwingBuilder inside a SWT application is working again. 
   
? In SwtBuilder eg. the button can have children (like onEvent, gridLayout, image).
  In SwingBuilder they can not: everything is attributes. Should this be changed?
  
? FactoryBuilderSupport: GroupNames, for register<group of widget> ??? Relevant ????

? Any need for CustomSwingBuilder?

? TableTree, TableTreeItem are deprecated - should they be removed?

- added automatic download of eclipse libraries
- added support for RadioGroupFieldEditor (used in Preferences)
- added support for StyledText
- Fixed a bug in WizardDialog
- swt.Dialog is abstract
- Fixed a bug using cascading MenuManagers
